# Cancer-Hotspots-Reformat
Reformatting cancer mutation data from the Cancer Hotspots database (https://www.cancerhotspots.org/)

This repository contains code for reformatting cancer mutation data extracted from the Cancer Hotspots database. The database stores genetic variant information in a specific format, including reference/alternative alleles and genomic positions. However, this format may not be suitable for further analysis and processing.

The code provided in this repository takes input data in the Cancer Hotspots format from a CSV file, performs data processing to reformat it into the standard format used for genetic variant data analysis (chr, start_position, end_position, reference_allele, alternative_allele), and exports the reformatted results to an Excel file.

Please note that the results generated by this code were utilized as part of an MSc project at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids Hospital) by a student in the Costain lab.

## Getting Started

To use this code, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pandas library (install using `pip install pandas`)

### Installation

1. Download the Jupyter Notebook file: data_reformatting_script.ipynb 

### Usage
Prepare your input data file named data.csv with the required columns: 'Hugo_Symbol', 'Amino_Acid_Position', 'Reference_Amino_Acid', 'Variant_Amino_Acid', 'Codon_Change', and 'Genomic_Position'.

Run the script using Jupyter Notebook. 

The script will process the data, generate results, and save them in an Excel file named data_reformat_results.xlsx.
